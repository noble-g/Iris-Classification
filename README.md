# Iris-Classification

Memories took me back to one of the data science projects I did when I was a novice in the data world- Iris classification on the popular iris dataset collected by the one of the founding father of statistics, Sir Ronald Fisher. There was no much of a preprocessing to be done, so I did lots of exploration and visualization to compensate. the code is self explanatory, you can go through it here.

With an accuracy of 100%, I modelled the data on logistic regression
